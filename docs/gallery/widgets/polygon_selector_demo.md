显示如何以交互方式选择多边形的索引。

输出：

```python
Select points in the figure by enclosing them within a polygon.
Press the 'esc' key to start a new polygon.
Try holding the 'shift' key to move all of the vertices.
Try holding the 'ctrl' key to move a single vertex.

Selected points:
[]
```

```python
import numpy as np

from matplotlib.widgets import PolygonSelector
from matplotlib.path import Path


class SelectFromCollection(object):
    """Select indices from a matplotlib collection using `PolygonSelector`.

    Selected indices are saved in the `ind` attribute. This tool fades out the
    points that are not part of the selection (i.e., reduces their alpha
    values). If your collection has alpha < 1, this tool will permanently
    alter the alpha values.

    Note that this tool selects collection objects based on their *origins*
    (i.e., `offsets`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    ax : :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`
        Axes to interact with.

    collection : :class:`matplotlib.collections.Collection` subclass
        Collection you want to select from.

    alpha_other : 0 <= float <= 1
        To highlight a selection, this tool sets all selected points to an
        alpha value of 1 and non-selected points to `alpha_other`.
